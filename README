Quality Control Warning:

I'm a Ruby neophyte! But I'm hoping in the very near future to not accompany my work with warnings!

Within this repo are all of my lovely practice examples from "Ruby the Hard Way!" by Zed Shaw.
You can view this book online here: http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/

An additional resource I found helpful in guiding me thru these exercises can be found here:

and my experience learning Ruby (after 13+ years of experience in healthcare, and minimal exposure to programming)
can be found here:
